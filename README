THIS IS A TEST REPO AND PROBABLY WON'T WORK. I'm about to make a "production" 
repo for this project since I've gotten a decent amount of people asking how
to compile it. 
When I have the next stable release (probably tomorrow) I will make a test 
branch and leave the master one only for stable releases (stable as in "it 
compiles, runs, has no major bugs, no features taken out, and code is 
moderately clean")
